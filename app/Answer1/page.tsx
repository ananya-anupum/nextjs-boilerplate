  <h1>Challenge: We noticed a concerning trend of high customer churn within the first 90 days of purchase for the newer segment of customers with relatively lower revenue. This segment was of great importance as it has the largest customer base and attempting to work out a solution here would impact the whole organization.
<br/> <br/>
  Analysis: Upon analysis, the root cause was identified as a lack of onboarding support for new customers. Unfortunately, directly onboarding a large customer base was not possible due to resource limitations.
<br/> <br/>  
  Solution: I participated in a pilot program that addressed this challenge. We implemented a simple in-product button labeled "Complimentary Onboarding." Clicking this button generates a support ticket automatically routed to our onboarding and customer success teams.
<br/> <br/> 
  Results: This low-cost solution yielded significant results. Within a single quarter, over 250 customers utilized the onboarding program. Moreover, churn for this customer segment decreased by 8% and has remained consistently lower.

  <h1>Hi Customer,
<br/> <br/>

  <br/> <br/>  
  I'm glad to hear that you're getting started with our platform and interested in exploring options for monitoring and logging your deployments. Vercel offers some great in-house tools to get you started, however we also understand if you’re looking to integrate third-party solutions that best suit your specific needs and preferences. 
  <br/> <br/>  
  Vercel provides robust monitoring and logging capabilities through our in-house observability products.This allows you to track deployment status, errors, and basic performance metrics. I’m happy to guide you through the setup and usage of these tools to ensure you get the most out of them. You can refer to this document as well for more information. 
<br/>  However, if you're considering third-party integrations for monitoring and logging, we can provide recommendations and assist you in integrating these solutions with your Vercel projects. 
  <br/> <br/>  
  Our goal is to ensure that you have the right tools at your disposal to work effectively on your project with Vercel. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about specific monitoring needs or the integration process with Vercel and I’ll be glad to assist you.

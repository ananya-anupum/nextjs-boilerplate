  Thank you for reaching out. Trust you are doing well.
  
  To redirect the /blog path to another website, please follow the below steps:
  
  Login to your Vercel account - Project Dashboard - Settings/Configuration - Routing Settings - Add the new redirect rule - Save.
  
  After saving the changes, you can test this by visiting your project's "/blog" path. It should now automatically redirect to the specified destination URL.
  You can also refer to these articles below for reference:

  Best regards,
  Ananya

  <h1>Next.js and Angular are both popular frameworks used by front end developers. Please find below the comparison - 
<br/> <br/>
  Next.js:
<br/>  
  Next.js is written in JavaScript and built on top of React.
<br/>  Offers features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for fast initial page loads and improved SEO.
<br/>  Next.js enforces certain ways of doing things, which might not be ideal for developers who prefer more flexibility, however the learning curve is relatively easier for those who are familiar with React.
<br/>  Offers excellent performance with its SSR and SSG capabilities, resulting in faster initial page loads and improved SEO.
<br/><br/>  
  Angular
  
  Angular is a TypeScript-based framework and is built by Google.
  Offers a robust framework with built-in features for routing, data binding, and dependency injection.
  Angular has a steeper learning curve due to its comprehensive nature and developers need to grasp various concepts like modules, components and decorators.
  While Angular applications can be optimized for performance, its CSR approach may result in slower initial page loads compared to SSR.

  <h1>The exercise is very effective since it handles real-world scenarios and queries that Vercel customers tend to have. It has been fun getting to learn and setting up the project on Vercel.
<br/> <br/>
<br/>  For non-technical Customer Success Managers (CSMs), the exercise could benefit from more detailed information on launching and deploying projects on Vercel given that the Customer Success function typically doesn't require extensive coding knowledge. We are focused on helping the customer achieve success in their business/project by effectively setting up the product and this often involves collaborating with technical teams and coordinating with customers to provide tailored assistance.
<br/>  I would appreciate some clarification on the expected level of technical knowledge for Vercel CSMs. Are CSMs expected to handle advanced technical aspects for customers, or should they focus on customer queries and liaising with technical teams?
<br/>  The 3-hour timeframe for the exercise might be challenging considering the learning curve for non-technical users. Given the additional time commitment outside of regular work hours, extending the deadline would be greatly appreciated.
 <br/> 
  That said, I’m looking forward to discussing more about this role and how I can contribute to Vercel’s growth and success.

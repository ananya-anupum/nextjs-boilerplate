  <h1> Hi Customer,

  Thank you for reaching out. Trust you are doing well.
  
  I understand that you have some queries regarding Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, and Edge Middleware on Vercel. Deciding between these depends on your specific needs. 
  To give a brief description here, if you require a low latency and lightweight functionality, choose Edge functions. 
  If you have a requirement with full Node.js capabilities for complex backend logic, you can choose Serverless Functions.
  If you want to modify requests before reaching your functions, choose Edge Middleware, however this is usually used in conjunction with the above options.
  
  That said, it would be great if you could share more details about your project, we can provide customized recommendations and assistance to ensure the best fit for your use case.
  
  Best regards,
  Ananya

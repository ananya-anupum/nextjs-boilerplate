  <h1>Hi Customer,

  Thank you for reaching out. Trust you are doing well.
  
  I completely understand your frustration and I apologize for the inconvenience you’re facing. Vercel redirects are a well-supported feature, and I believe it is not a platform issue. Vercel offers a couple of ways to set up redirects, and sometimes a small change is enough to make it work. 
  To assist you better, could you please provide some details regarding your project type and if the target website is publicly accessible? It would also be great if you could share the error messages you’re facing during this setup so that I can discuss it internally with our technical team and get back to you with further information. 
  
  Please be assured that we are committed to your satisfaction and we will work on getting this resolved at the earliest once we have the details.
  
  Looking forward to hearing from you.
  
  Best regards,
  Ananya

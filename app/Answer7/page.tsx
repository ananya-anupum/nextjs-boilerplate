  <h1>The first step is to understand their usage by gathering information on their current usage patterns. Based on the usage patterns, we can suggest relevant optimization approaches:

  Here are some ideas to consider that can lower their Serverless Function's execution time:
  
  Make sure to set your Serverless Function's region as close to your data sources as geographically possible.
  What exactly is slow? The 3rd party API? If yes, can you trigger a request to the API and fetch the result later?
  Introduce a caching layer between the 3rd party API and your Serverless Functions.
  Move the workload to another environment; Reconsider if it would be better to offload work inside your Serverless Function to the client, etc.
  As a general rule, Serverless Functions on Vercel should be lightweight helpers for frontend applications.
  
  Provide documentation that might benefit them.

  By following the above steps, we can equip the new Next.js and Vercel user with the knowledge and tools to effectively manage serverless function overages and optimize their deployments and also let them know that they can reach out to you if they need any assistance during this process and we can offer tailored guidance to better assist them
